                    I am delighted you have found your way to this portal.
                    My wish is for us to find a place in the Universal Field
                    where we can journey together through the landscape of the body with our
                    curiosity and wonderment, and reclaim our own innate freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is nothing higher we can achieve in this Earth School than the innate
                    knowledge of ourselves through the access of our Body Minds. I invite your to 
                    enter the journey with meâ€¦
