### Forking
Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.
This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

You can make a copy of the GitHub Repository by "forking" the original repository onto your own account, 
where changes can be made without affecting the original repository by taking the following steps: 

   
1. Login to your account on [Github](https://github.com/).
2. Locate the [Repository](https://github.com/Joan-Amudu/Peduns-Farm) used for this project.
3. On the right-hand side of the Repository name, you'll see the 'Fork' button.
4. This will create a copy in your personal repository.
5. Once you're finished making changes, return to original repository and press 'New Pull Request' to request your changes to be merged into the original project.
